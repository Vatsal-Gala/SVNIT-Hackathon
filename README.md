## Theme - Smart City (Traffic Management System)

The basic idea of this simulation is to provide an efficient traffic management control to a smart city especially for Emergency Service vehicles i.e Ambulance, Fire Brigade, Police.  
  
We have used a specific Javascript library called __p5.js__.  
  
Logic behind this application is that-  
1. Emergency Service vehicle pre-determines the route to its destination using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and sends it to central server/control room.  
2. Control room switches all the signals to green when the Emergency vehicle approaches the signal in its route.  
3. This ensures smooth movement of traffic and thereby does not hinder the path of Emergency vehicle.
